				Right, there's nothing to see right now as I'm still building out my pages site.  But basically this will be my full production project github, whereas my personal github is over on my Streon github.  Basically it's for prototyping concepts that are yet ready for primetime development yet.  When it does reach primetime status, development will be transfered to this github account.

				Confusing?  Perhaps. But for a developer like me who likes to gallivant across concepts and experiments on a whim, having a personal playground of repos detached from actualized projects makes sense to me.
