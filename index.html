			<h3>Current Projects</h3>
			<label>Projects are ordered by state of activity from most active to least active/complete</label>
			<ul>
				<li>Hyper Content Drifter - A basic web scraper-like tool that uses specifically written explorer scripts called "drifters" to traverse targeted web content</li>
				<li>Basic Node Server - Stripping down my node web server base into only parts that I use very very often.  It's a changing concept as I stand up needed tools/services</li>
				<li>Dead Simple Tools - Literally isolated single page offline tools that are dead simple concepts at heart but what I consider very useful</li>
				<li>Mini-Cli - A collection of minify/beautify scripts in one cli application with batch functionality</li>
				<li>Epub-Server - My attempt at an Epub reader written in Node</li>
				<li>Archive-Server - My attempt at an archive (7z) reader written in Node</li>
